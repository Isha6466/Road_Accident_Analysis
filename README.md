# Road_Accident_Analysis
I have done analysis of Road Accidents and then prediction with the help of the dataset from Kaggle. This project is done using Machine Learning in Python. 
In this project I have used 5 Supervised technique Random Forest, Decission Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM and KNN and 1 Unsupervised technique K-Means Clustering.
